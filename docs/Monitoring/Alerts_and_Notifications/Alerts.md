# Alerts

Every minute, the system evaluates a rule. If the rule is found to be true, an alert is generated. For example, a rule might be set for CPU usage exceeding 85%. The system checks this rule every minute to determine its validity.

To view the alerts go to [app.metisdata.io/alerts](http://app.metisdata.io/alerts). 

On the Alerts page, you'll find details such as the timestamp of the last alert occurrence and its severity level. Presently, the system retains a history spanning the last 24 hours. However, upcoming versions will extend this capability to store a significantly longer history.

If you've configured an alert but it hasn't surpassed the threshold, no alert will be generated, and you won't find it displayed here.
