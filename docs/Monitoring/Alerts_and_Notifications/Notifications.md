# Notifications

Every alert triggered within Metis is recorded and can be accessed on the "Alerts" page. However, similar to many other alert tools, Metis also has the capability to send notifications to the organization's existing notification system. These notifications typically include basic contextual information along with a link to the corresponding alert for more detailed information.

## Configura a Notification 

The configuration of the Notification is done in two steps:

1. Configure the integration (done once)
2. Configure the exact notification channel of each Rule

:::note
‚ùó As of Mar 24' only Slack and Jira are supported. More integrations coming soon
:::

## Configure the Notifications Integrations 
Open the page [app.metisdata.io/integrations](http://app.metisdata.io/integrations). Select the integration and follow the instructions.
